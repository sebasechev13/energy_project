# energy_project
We decided to analyze the type of power plants in every country to see how energy efficient the G6 countries are and 
China. We plotted on a world the top 10 energy producing plants in each country and we also plotted the total consumption of energy in the country
and the total production which stays inside the country amount both amounts in M Toes. We also then analyzed that information in a horizontal
bar graph.
